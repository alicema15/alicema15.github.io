                            <h3>Hello World</h3>
                            <p>&nbsp;At Archer, we start from a fundamental belief: people are inherently interested in issues of systemic and geopolitical urgency but they often lack the way to contribute their time. We believe if we empower people through providing and building technology, they will increase access to data and engagement for themselves, their communities, and the world at large. This guiding principle in our work stems from our own story.<br/> <br/>

                            The summer of 2016 was one that rocked the UC Berkeley community with the passing of Tarishi Jain and Nick Leslie to acts of terrorism in Dhaka and Nice respectively. For many of us at Archer, both events changed our perspective on what global issues demanded our attention as we were either present or had friends present at both attacks. We chose to use our technological skill set to show how the product-scaling model can be leveraged for good. <br/> <br/>

                            In our first year, Archer partnered with organizations to build creative solutions to assist the investigative processes. The tools that emerged included <a href="https://www.sanctionsexplorer.org">Sanctions Explorer</a>, <a href="https://www.dashbit.co">Dashbit</a> and Meta, receiving coverage from the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-berkeley-students-fight-terrorism-20170430-story.html">LA Times</a>, <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/04/30/students-in-2016-nice-rampage-respond-by-fighting-global-terrorism/">Berkeley News</a> and others.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            Now, almost in its second year, Archer is leveraging the experience gained from previous partnerships to create <b>a single platform for crowd-sourced investigative knowledge.</b>
                            <br/> <br/>

                            The Archer ecosystem is built to generate actionable insight from disparate and often inaccessible datasets whether it be a press releases, bank statements, photos or government data sets. Our view of the future is one where we, as citizens, have the analytic capacity to demand transparency and promote accountability.<br/> <br/>
